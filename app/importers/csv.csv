Evaluating the effects of induced development on flood hazards and losses in U.S. communities with levees,,Dissertation,"III, Herbert E. Longenecker",,Floods|~|Levees|~|Flood risk|~|Floodplains|~|Risk Management|~|Induced development,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Floods|~|Levees|~|Flood risk|~|Floodplains|~|Risk Management|~|Induced development,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng,,,,,,"The research undertaken in this study evaluates changes in the risk and vulnerability of residential building construction and valuation of eight cities in the United States to assess the changes in flood risk across levee-protected and non-leveed riverine floodplains. Floods cause more losses than any other hazard in the U.S. and losses continue to increase despite longstanding loss reduction policies and practices. To estimate whether levees increase the risk and vulnerability of residential buildings to flooding, this study analyzes residential tax parcels, levee and protected-area data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Levee Database, and regulatory floodplain zoning data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which administers the National Flood Insurance Program, intended to discourage floodplain development when alternatives are available and encourage mitigation practices and participation in insurance coverage to lessen the necessity for disaster relief funding when flooding inevitably occurs. With empirical information about the history and locations of residential development, the study develops a taxonomy of floodplain occupation types and employs difference-indifferences regression to evaluate treatment (i.e. levee-protected) and control (i.e. non-leveed, non-floodplain) groups before and after levee construction; further, the study constructs a deep history of wetland reclamation to consider path dependency as a theory for explaining changes in residential flood risk and vulnerability. The results of the study indicate that levees are associated with increasing residential buildings’ value-at-risk of flooding and increasing vulnerability to flood losses due to canceling of required insurance participation through levee accreditation.",Geography,,,"Travis, William R.","Leyk, Stefan|~|Spielman, Seth|~|Pielke, Roger|~|Jr., |~|Wood, Nathan J.",,2019-08-22,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50000485,Doctoral,,,2019,,15523695|https://scholar.colorado.edu/geog_gradetds/159,k643b116n,open,processed/15523695/evaluatingTheEffectsOfInducedDevelopmentOnFloodHazardsAn.pdf,,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
"From “Retire Livestock, Restore Rangeland” to the Compensation for Ecological Services: State Interventions into Rangeland Ecosystems and Pastoralism in Tibet",,Dissertation,"Yundannima, ",,degradation|~|ecosystem|~|intervention|~|pastoralism|~|rangeland|~|Tibet,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,degradation|~|ecosystem|~|intervention|~|pastoralism|~|rangeland|~|Tibet,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng,,,,,,"This dissertation investigates China’s tuimu huancao and destocking policy under a Compensation for Ecosystem Services program as a case study of how “received wisdom” environmental degradation narratives are used to justify state interventions into the livelihoods of minority pastoralists. Tuimu huancao calls for grazing bans and restrictions by fencing for the purpose of restoring purportedly degraded rangeland and protecting rangeland. The destocking policy is intended to adjust herd size to carrying capacity through a reward mechanism for the purpose of protecting rangeland.
It examines the scientific and theoretical foundations of these two policies and the way in which they are understood, received, negotiated, and contested in multiple ways through a case study from Nagchu Prefecture, Tibet. The framework for analyzing these two programs as state interventions draws from and contributes to political ecology. Field research of an ethnographic study used a mix of methods that included detailed household surveys, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, oral histories, focus groups, transect walks, participatory mapping and participant observation.
This dissertation argues that tuimu huancao and the destocking policy ultimately have the effect more of intensifying existing policy directions that transform traditional pastoralism than of mitigating rangeland degradation, restoration and protection. Hence, narratives of rangeland degradation underpinning tuimu huancao and the destocking policy serve to justify state interventions that aim to achieve this goal of transforming traditional pastoralism. Furthermore, broadly defined political and economic forces maintain the persistence of “received wisdom” on pastoralism and prevent alternative perspectives to existing policy directions from emerging. This dissertation also argues that Tibetan pastoralism can be well adapted to state interventions based on a middle way approach that accommodates both development and the livestock components of pastoralism. Nonetheless, the dissertation demonstrates that the formation of such a policy will not be easy because it will be a political process and can be jeopardized by officials’ vested political and economic interests.",Geography,,,"Yeh, Emily T.","Klein, Julia A.|~|Goldman, Mara",,2012,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50000485,Doctoral,,,2012,,9053372|https://scholar.colorado.edu/geog_gradetds/30,k643b116n,open,processed/9053372/fromRetireLivestockRestoreRangelandToTheCompensationFo.pdf,,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
"Leading the Herd: Drought, Governance, and Exit in the Contemporary U.S. Beef Value Chain",,Dissertation,"Lake, Sarah",,Global value chains|~|U.S. beef industry|~|private standards,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Global value chains|~|U.S. beef industry|~|private standards,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng,,,,,,"As the most valuable agricultural commodity in the U.S., beef is both an economic and cultural foundation of modern American agriculture. Uniting core perspectives from economic, environmental, and agri-food sociology, I examine ongoing transitions in the beef industry that illuminate the factors shaping the structure of the industry and their implications for different industry actors. Stemming heavily from the global value chains tradition, yet also drawing new connections the value chain literature and natural disasters and food regime research, I provide a close analysis of how the rise of private standards, extreme drought, and generational transition form a crucible of pressures reshaping the landscape of American agriculture. As a highly fragmented industry, the beef value chain provides an excellent opportunity to understand how exchanges between distinct segments of the chain—cow-calf producers, feedlots, processors, and retailers—are governed. My findings underscore the variation that exists within a particular value chain segment, and show that a single firm can participate in multiple governance arrangements simultaneously—even with the same exchange partner. The expansion of private standards within the beef industry influences these governance types but with uneven effects for producers depending on the nature of the standard (collective versus individual), and thus the degree to which the standard can ""lock"" upstream producers into particular relationships with particular buyers. Together, governance, environmental pressures, and a generational transition encourage exit from the industry, while a strong commitment to hegemonic masculinity and a work ethic valuing self-reliance and dedication keeps beef producers in a seemingly unprofitable business.",Sociology,,,"Bair, Jennifer","Tierney, Kathleen|~|Harrison, Jill|~|Reed, Isaac|~|Raynolds, Laura",,2014,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50000485,Doctoral,,,2014,,9791784|https://scholar.colorado.edu/socy_gradetds/37,k643b116n,open,processed/9791784/leadingTheHerdDroughtGovernanceAndExitInTheContempora.pdf,,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
Mathematics Assessment in the Race to the Top Era: an Exploratory Study of the Semiotic Resources in Large-Scale Assessment and Their Use by Emergent and Non-Emergent Bilingual Students,,Dissertation,"Shade, Chelsey Amber",,emergent bilingual students|~|mathematics assessment|~|non-emergent bilingual students|~|smarter balanced assessment consortium|~|education,,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,emergent bilingual students|~|mathematics assessment|~|non-emergent bilingual students|~|smarter balanced assessment consortium|~|education,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng,,,,,,"Current policy mandates that emergent bilingual (EB) students partake in standardized assessments before they are fully proficient in English.  Additionally, standardized assessments are quickly converting to an online administration.  The increase in design features inherent in computer-based assessments will most likely increase the number of construct-irrelevant factors and affect the accessibility of assessment items for EBs.This study used frequency analyses, descriptive statistics, item semiotic complexity measures, Spearman’s rank-order correlation, one- and two-way analysis of variance, and Chi-square test of independence to examine the semiotic components and complexity of items included in a Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Grade 8 practice test, and how the semiotic features of the items affected non-EB and EB students as they solved four of the items.  Results indicate that the SBAC items have different ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions as well as intersemiotic relations than items in curriculum resources.  The average item semiotic complexity was approximately 69 components, indicating that students had to correctly interpret, as intended by the item writers, 69 different constituents to answer an item correctly.  Regardless of language group, students’ reported actions and thinking involved very few semiotic components or intersemiotic relations belonging to the test items.For all items combined, EBs had a higher total cognitive load than non-EBs.  As item semiotic complexity increased, EBs’ scores decreased while non-EBs’ scores remained constant once a certain item semiotic complexity level was reached.  Results indicate that as cognitive load decreased, total score increased for both language groups.  Additionally, total cognitive load negatively affected both groups of students during problem-solving and non-EBs during interpretation.  This study provides the PARCC and SBAC assessment consortia with information relevant to designing test items using multiple semiotic resources used in computer-based assessments in ways that are sensitive to the characteristics of EB students.  Results from this study contribute to the establishment of a research agenda on the relationship between the semiotic properties of test items and the achievement of EB students in large-scale tests.  Additionally, the information gained from this study informs teachers on how they can use semiotic resources to support their students in the classroom.",School of Education,,,"Escamilla, Kathy","Solano-Flores, Guillermo|~|Aldama, Arturo|~|Hopewell, Susan|~|Taylor, Edd",,2017,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50000485,Doctoral,,,2017,,13435398|https://scholar.colorado.edu/educ_gradetds/115,k643b116n,open,processed/13435398/mathematicsAssessmentInTheRaceToTheTopEraAnExploratory.pdf,,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
CHARACTERIZING PHOTOBIOREGENERATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR SIMULTANEOUS THERMAL CONTROL AND AIR REVITALIZATION OF SPACECRAFT AND SURFACE HABITATS,,Dissertation,"Matula, Emily E.",,Environmental Control and Life Support Systems|~|Algae|~|Thermal Control|~|Air Revitalization|~|Bioregenerative|~|Closed Loop,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,Environmental Control and Life Support Systems|~|Algae|~|Thermal Control|~|Air Revitalization|~|Bioregenerative|~|Closed Loop,http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng,,,,,,"Algal photobioreactors have been researched as potential solutions to air revitalization in a spacecraft cabin environment by absorbing CO₂ and producing O₂ through photosynthesis. This photosynthesis, and consumption of produced biomass, theoretically provides a closed-loop solution for long-duration spaceflight. Addressing multiple spaceflight requirements simultaneously with algae has the potential to reduce launch mass, power and volume of future Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) systems. Additionally, inoculating algal culture into a water-based thermal cooling loops (flight-proven standard of active cooling found on the International Space Station (ISS)) could incorporate simultaneous air revitalization and thermal control into a common system. However, this imparts rapid, extreme thermal swings on algal cells not evolved for culture in a transient thermal environment. Therefore, the effect of dynamic thermal environments on the CO₂/O₂ turnover of algae was characterized to provide a first-order assessment of system feasibility. This research characterizes the effect of dynamic environments, both transient thermal environments and varying levels of CO₂ concentration, on metabolic processes of the algal culture. Experiments using Antarctic algal species were included to investigate if cold-acclimated algae are more efficient than Chlorella at CO₂/O₂ turnover in the active cooling environment. The simultaneous heat and mass transfer coefficients of a nonporous, gas-permeable membrane were characterized, and membrane models developed for future design considerations. A photobioreactor system was designed with considerations for gravity-independence, prototyped, and tested using parameters defined by the ISS cabin environment. A failure modes and effect analysis distilled lessons learned from the previous experiments, which also informs the use of algae for bioregenerative life support. In conclusion, the resulting values from the previous characterization experiments, along with values found in literature, were used to make a first-order mass-balance comparison between current ISS ECLSS and photobioregenerative technologies. This work serves as an initial evaluation of the feasibility for using an algal photobioreactor for simultaneous air revitalization and active thermal control of a spacecraft or surface habitat.",Aerospace Engineering Sciences,,,"Nabity, James A.","Klaus, David|~|Clark, Torin|~|Lewis, William|~|Barta, Daniel",,2019-11-01,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50000485,Doctoral,,,2019,,15685338|https://scholar.colorado.edu/asen_gradetds/258,k643b116n,open,processed/15685338/characterizingPhotobioregenerativeTechnologyForSimultaneousT.pdf,,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
